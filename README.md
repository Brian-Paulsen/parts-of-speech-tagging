# Parts of Speech Tagging

This project uses an LSTM to do parts of speech tagging using the brown corpus.

## Brown Corpus

The Brown Corpus was compiled back in the 1960s. It contains 1 million words from mostly news articles. More information about
it can be found [here](http://korpus.uib.no/icame/manuals/BROWN/INDEX.HTM). I got the dataset from Kaggle, which can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/nltkdata/brown-corpus).
